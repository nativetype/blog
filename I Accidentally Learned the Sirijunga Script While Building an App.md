Before I start another paragraph I want to clarify that I grew up in this community where Limbu language was spoken. I can understand and speak a little, but Sirijanga script was something I never learned.

When I started building nativetype.com, I thought I was just solving a technical challenge: making typing in underrepresented scripts fast, intuitive, and fun.

I didn’t realize it would turn into a personal journey; one that taught me Sirijunga, a script from the Limbu community, in ways school never did.

## Learning by Building (Not Memorizing)

I didn’t start with oldschool textbooks. I started with **problems**:
- What [Limbu keyboard](https://nativetype.com/keyboard/limbu) layout makes sense?
- Which [consonant–vowel](https://nativetype.com/characters/limbu) combinations are intuitive?
- Where do users hesitate?

Every design choice forced me to engage with the script actively. Instead of memorizing characters, I was:
- Typing them repeatedly
- Debugging my own confusion
- Noticing patterns emerge

Slowly, the script stopped being abstract. It became **muscle memory**.

## Designing for Learners Like Me

Because I was learning while building, **nativetype reflects my own struggles**:
- Minimal UI to reduce cognitive load
- High-contrast, immediate feedback
- Focus on rhythm, speed, and recognition

I wasn’t designing for an expert. I was designing for someone halfway between curiosity and insecurity — someone learning a script for the first time.

That someone was me.

## What nativetype Gave Back

Building nativetype didn’t just ship a feature. It gave me:
- Daily exposure to a script I didn’t know before
- A reason to practice consistently
- A way to learn without shame
- A sense of contribution, not just consumption

The app became **both a product and a teacher**.

If you want to learn like me you can begin with [Limbu Typing Lessons](https://nativetype.com/typing/limbu) or if you already know the keyboard then [test your Limbu(Sirijanga) typing speed and accuracy](https://nativetype.com/test/limbu) on 3 different levels.

nativetype is still evolving. So is my relationship with Sirijunga.

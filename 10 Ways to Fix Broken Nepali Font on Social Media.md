Let me guess.

You typed a beautiful Nepali post in “Unicode.”

You hit publish.

And it still has broken Nepali characters. Text with weird spacing and unreadable text.

Frustrating? Yes.


You’re not alone.

This Nepali text problem hits hard in Nepal. I believe its #1 issue for Nepali users typing in Nepali Unicode to share their thoughts, business or any Nepali content on social media.

Here’s the real reason and the fix.

## The Hidden Problem: "Wrong Unicode" Nepali
This is where almost everyone messes up.

Even though Unicode is the global for languages on the internet:

Google reads it.

Facebook supports it.

LinkedIn indexes it.

The phone displays it correctly.


People often type incorrect Unicode characters like in legacy Preeti font. That’s why your Nepali turns into garbage text.

Not a bug.

Not a device issue.

It’s an encoding mismatch.

The simple Fix: 
>**Unicode is not Preeti Font**

Stop typing like you are in a Dinosaur era of Preeti font.
Your content turns into garbage because you’re treating unicode as a good old Preeti font.

Here are 10 ways to fix your broken Nepali content on social media:

## Mistake #1: Using ा + े Instead of ो
This is the most common error.

They look identical but they are technically different.

And computers don’t forgive that.

People type:

**ा + े → ाे**

Instead of using:

**ो (single Unicode character)**

To type ‘को’ use क + ो but not क + ा + े like in preeti.
You can type ो using key combination **Shift + Q**

## Mistake #2: Typing “ि” Before the Letter
This one breaks Nepali text even faster.

Many people type:

**ि + क → िक**

Because visually, ि appears before the letter.

But unicode doesn’t work visually.

**The correct Rule:**
1. Always type the consonant first
2. Then type the vowel

So for कि: type **क + ि**. Unicode will automatically place **ि** before **क**.

## Mistake #3: Typing अ + ा Instead of आ
This mistake is everywhere.

People type:

**अ + ा**

That creates two separate characters, not a real आ.

To type आ you can use **Right Alt [AltGr] + C** or in mac **Right ⌥ option + C**

## Mistake #4: Typing उ + ू Instead of  ऊ
Typing उ + ू creates two characters, not a real ऊ.

This will cause rendering issues on social media like Facebook or Tiktok.

Unicode expects one character, not a combination.

To type **ऊ** you can press **Right Alt [AltGr] + P** or **Right ⌥ option + P** on mac.

## Mistake #5: Wrongly typing औ 
औ is an independent vowel

People type:

**अ + ा + ै**

That is already 3 different characters. Combined version confuses rendering engines and breaks on social media.

To type **औ** press **Right Alt [AltGr] + ]** or **Right ⌥ option + ]**

## Mistake #6: typing र्इ instead of ई
**ई** is also an independent vowel

People type:

**र् + इ** or **इ + र्**

Looks good while typing but when rendered it's obvious to break on other platforms.

Type **ई** directly using **Shift + Right Alt [AltGr] + O** or for mac users **Shift + Right ⌥ option + O** 

## Mistake #7: ऐ (Ai Vowel)
Unicode treats **ऐ** as a standalone vowel.

People type:

**ए + े**

This is a visual shortcut; not Unicode-correct.

Combining characters reduces text reliability online.

To type **ऐ** use key combination of **Shift + Right Alt [AltGr] + P** or on mac **Shift + right ⌥ option + P**

## Mistake #8 ओ (O Vowel)
Similar to *ऐ, ई* the **‘ओ’** is also single Unicode character.

People often type:

**अ + ा + े**

Combining vowels fails during online render on different platforms. That’s why press keys **Shift + Right Alt [AltGr] + ]** or **Shift + Right ⌥ option + ]** for **ओ**

## Mistake #9 ौ (Au Matra)
People try to create by combining matras like
**ा + ै**

Always type **ौ** as a single Unicode matra.

**Shift + Right Alt [AltGr] + Q** or **Shift + right ⌥ option + Q**

If you correct these 9 mistakes you are already preventing 90% of the Nepali Unicode issues.

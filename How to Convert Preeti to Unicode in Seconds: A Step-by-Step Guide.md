Are you still struggling with text that looks like a jumble of English letters when you try to share your Nepali documents? 🤯 

For years, the **Preeti font** has been the backbone of Nepali typing. But in today’s digital world, Preeti is a "legacy" font. It doesn't show up on mobile phones, it’s invisible to Google Search, and you can’t post it on social media.

The solution? **Unicode.**

In this guide, we’ll show you how to use the fastest tool available to modernize your text instantly.

I want to share something small I’ve been working on.

I’ve added an [Urdu keyboard](https://nativetype.com/keyboard/urdu) to NativeType.com.

You can also use [Urdu Document Editor](https://nativetype.com/editor/urdu).

No big launch.

No long roadmap.

Just something useful.

## Instead of waiting for the “perfect” version, I decided to start simple.
Right now, NativeType only supports:
- an Urdu Keyboard
- an Urdu Document Editor
- nothing more, nothing less

There are no typing tests yet.

There are no lessons yet.

And that's okay.

The goal was straightforeward: open the site and type in Urdu without friction.

I'll keep improving Nativetype slowly.

Based on real use. Based on real feedback.

If you try the Urdu Keyboard and have thoughts; good/bad; I'd love to hear them.

That's it for now.

More SOON.
